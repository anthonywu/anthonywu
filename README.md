## About Me

For over 20 years, everything I touch at work, I ship!

- Early career: Eng at YouTube during early scale up years at Google.
- Co-Founder and CTO at LearnSprout, a Python data company acquired by Apple in 2016.
- 4+ years embedded with an org of math/physics PhDs helping with their software and infrastructure.

With a strong belief in _action begets information_ and always working with a sense of urgency, I help my teams compete and win.

My engineering philosophy is centered around agility: plan and execute in short cycles of hours or days.

With rapid iteration and feedback loops, I help small and young teams minimize "worked on the wrong thing" risk.

### Currently

- ✈️ Based in San Francisco, but frequently traveling
- 👨🏻‍💻 Contributing to OSS after a ~9 year OSS hiatus due to working at [ Big Fruit Inc](https://www.apple.com/)
- ✨ Evaluating every AI-assisted CLI and IDE available to find their strengths
- 🌟 Frequently starring, cloning, and contributing to repos w/Python, GenAI, LLM and Local-First software stacks

## Open to Opportunities

- **🤝🏼 Advisory**: Hourly fee. Video or SF in-person. Technical due diligence, architecture/code reviews, eng team building/hiring
- **💼 Consulting**: Project-based pricing. Python/AI app architecture, AI/ML workflow
- **🛠️ Fractional Engineer**: Early-stage startups needing technical leadership
- **🏢 Full Time**: Only considering extremely good fits. Happy to explore.
- **🚀 Co-Founder Opportunities**: Also seeking only extremely good fits. If we have mutuals, lets chat!

### Ideal Projects

- 👨🏼‍🏫 Video or on-site training, limited scope and time engagement.
- 🏗️ Startups needing fractional CTO/VPE leadership, i.e. bootstrap good practices into engineering cultures
- 🔧 Companies modernizing infrastructure, i.e. upgrade runtimes, packaging and deploying into cloud services
- 🚀 Teams building GenAI/LLM applications, i.e. technology selection, planning and scoping
